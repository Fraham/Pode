# Static Content

Static content in Pode can be used by either places your static files with the `/public` directory, or by defining static routes. You can also specify default pages, such as `index.html`, for when users navigate to root folders.

Caching is also supported on static content.

## Static Routes

The following is an example of using the `route` function to define routes to static content directories; this tells Pode where to get static files from for certain routes. This example will define a static route for `/assets`, and will point to the route at the internal directory path of `./content/assets`:

```powershell
server {
    listen *:8080 http
    route static '/assets' './content/assets'
}
```

The following request will retrieve an image from the `./content/assets/images` directory:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://localhost:8080/assets/images/icon.png' -Method Get
```

## Default Pages

For static content, Pode also supports returning default pages when a root static content directory is requested. The inbuilt default pages are:

```plain
index.html
index.htm
default.html
default.htm
```

These pages are checked in order, and if one is found then its content is returned. Using the above static route from the `Static Route` section, if the `./content/assets/home` directory contained an `index.html` page, then the following request would return the content for the `index.html` page:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://localhost:8080/assets/images/home' -Method Get
```

The default pages can be configured in two ways; either by using the `-Defaults` parameter on the `route` function, or by setting them in the `pode.json` [configuration file](../../Configuration). To set the defaults to be only a `home.html` page, both ways would work as follows:

*Defaults Parameter*
```powershell
route static '/assets' './content/assets' -d @('home.html')
```

*Configuration File*
```json
{
    "web": {
        "static": {
            "defaults": [ "home.html" ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Caching

Having web pages send requests to your Pode server for all static content every time can be quite a strain on the server. To help the server, you can enable static content caching, which will inform users' browsers to cache files (ie `*.css` and `*.js`) for so many seconds - stopping the browser from re-requesting it from your server each time.

By default, caching is disabled and can be enabled and controlled using the `pode.json` configuration file.

To enable caching, with a default cache time of 1hr, you do:

```json
{
    "web": {
        "static": {
            "cache": {
                "enable": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you wish to set a max cache time of 30mins, then you would use the `maxAge` property - setting it to `1800secs`:

```json
{
    "web": {
        "static": {
            "cache": {
                "enable": true,
                "maxAge": 1800
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Downloadable

Normally content accessed on a static route is rendered on the browser, but you can set the route to flag the files for downloading instead. If you add the `-DownloadOnly` (`-do`) switch to the static `route`, then accessing files on this route in a browser will cause them to be downloaded instead of rendered:

```powershell
server {
    listen *:8080 http
    route static '/assets' './content/assets' -do
}
```

When a static route is set as downloadable, then `-Defaults` and caching are not used.

### Include/Exclude

Sometimes you don't want all static content to be cached, maybe you want `*.exe` files to always be re-requested? This is possible using the `include` and `exclude` properties in the `pode.json`.

Let's say you do want to exclude all `*.exe` files from being cached:

```json
{
    "web": {
        "static": {
            "cache": {
                "enable": true,
                "exclude": [
                    "*.exe"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Or, you could setup some static routes called `/assets` and `/images`, and you want everything on `/images` to be cached, but only `*.js` files to be cached on `/assets`:

```json
{
    "web": {
        "static": {
            "cache": {
                "enable": true,
                "include": [
                    "/images/*",
                    "/assets/*.js"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

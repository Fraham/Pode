# Web Event

When a request is made to your server, a "web event" object is created that contains a lot of useful information about the request (and the response!).

This web event is a normal HashTable, and is always supplied as the first parameter to your Routes, Middleware, Endware, custom Authentication type ScriptBlocks:

```powershell
Add-PodeRoute -Method Get -Path '/' -ScriptBlock {
    param($e)
    # that $e is the web event!
}
```

## Properties

!!! warning
    It is advised not to directly alter these values, other than the ones through the documentation that say you can - such as Session Data.

## Customise

The web event itself is just a HashTable, which means you can add your own properties to it within Middleware for further use in other Middleware down the flow, or in the Route itself.

Make sure these custom properties have a unique name, so as to not clash with already existing properties.

# File

## Description

The `file` function writes the contents of a file to the web response. For dynamic files that have the same extension as the view engine, you can also supply data that can be passed to them. You can also set whether or not to inform the browser to cache the file.

The content type for the response, by default, is determined by the file's extension. However, you can also pass a content type this function to use on the response - overriding the default behaviour.

## Examples

### Example 1

The following example will write an XML file to the response stream:

```powershell
Server {
    listen *:8080 http

    route get '/data' {
        file './path/file.xml'
    }
}
```

### Example 2

The following example will write a dynamic text file to the response stream, supplying data needed to generate the file:

```powershell
Server {
    listen *:8080 http
    engine pode

    route get '/data' {
        file './path/file.txt.pode' -d @{ 'date' = [datetime]::UtcNow }
    }
}
```

# Known Issues

Below is a list of reported issues when using Pode and, if possible, how to resolve them:

## Long URL Segments

Reported in issue [#45](https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode/issues/45).

On Windows systems there is a limit on the maximum length of URL segments. It's usually about 260 characters, and anything above this will cause Pode to throw a 400 Bad Request error.

To resolve, you can set the `UrlSegmentMaxLength` registry setting to 0 (for unlimited), or any other value. The below PowerShell will set the value to unlimited:

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters' -Name 'UrlSegmentMaxLength' -Value 0 -PropertyType DWord -Force
```

> This is not an issue on Linux

## PowerShell Classes

Pode uses Runspaces to deal with multithreading and other background tasks. Due to this, PowerShell classes do not work as intended, and are unsafe to use.

You can find more information about this issue [here on PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3651).

The crux of the issue is that if you create an instance of a class in one Runspace, then every time you try to use that instance again it will always be marshaled back to the original Runspace. This means Routes and Middleware can become contaminated.

It's recommended to switch to either Hashtables or PSObjects, but if you need to use classes then the following should let classes work:

* Create a module (CreateClassInstanceHelper.psm1) with content:

```powershell
$Script:powershell = $null
$Script:body = @'
    function New-UnboundClassInstance ([Type]$type, [object[]]$arguments) {
        [activator]::CreateInstance($type, $arguments)
    }
'@

function Initialize
{
    # A runspace is created and NO powershell class is defined in it
    $Script:powershell = [powershell]::Create()

    # Define a function in that runspace to create an instance using the given type and arguments
    $Script:powershell.AddScript($Script:body).Invoke()
    $Script:powershell.Commands.Clear()
}

function New-UnboundClassInstance([Type]$type, [object[]]$arguments = $null)
{
    if ($null -eq $Script:powershell) {
        Initialize
    }

    try {
        # Pass in the powershell class type and ctor arguments and run the helper function in the other runspace
        if ($null -eq $arguments) {
            $arguments = @()
        }

        $result = $Script:powershell.AddCommand("New-UnboundClassInstance").
                                     AddParameter("type", $type).
                                     AddParameter("arguments", $arguments).
                                     Invoke()
        return $result[0]
    }
    finally {
        $Script:powershell.Commands.Clear()
    }
}
```

* Then when you need to create a PowerShell class instance, you can do the following from some Route or Middleware:

```powershell
Import-Module '<path>\CreateClassInstanceHelper.psm1'
New-UnboundClassInstance([Foo], $argsForCtor)
```

## Certificates

For HTTPS there are a few issues you may run into, and to resolve them you can use the below:

* On Windows, you may need to install the certificate into your Trusted Root on the Local Machine (mostly for self-signed certificates).
* You may be required to run the following, to force TLS1.2, before making web requests:

```powershell
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

* On *nix platforms, for self-signed certificates, you may need to use `-SkipCertificateCheck` on `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod`.
